bunsen\-os\-release \- Operating system identification
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
/etc/os/release
.PP
/etc/lsb\-release
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
BunsenLabs ships its own OS identification files as part of the
\f[B]bunsen\-os\-release\f[] package, which are located in their
standard paths as described in \f[B]fsg\f[](1) (part of the Linux
Standard Base) and \f[B]os\-release\f[](5) (part of the systemd
configuration environment).
The purpose of these files is to provide third\-party programs with
information about the OS such as name, distribution, and version.
In \f[B]os\-release\f[](5) in particular also allows for declaring the
operating system family, in the sense of BunsenLabs being derived from
Debian.
Programs which use this information include for example the GRUB
bootloader, which installs a boot menu with operating system selection
options, or package management software.
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
BunsenLabs preserves the original Debian OS information files.
\f[B]bunsen\-os\-release\f[] only defers the existing files to their BL
editions.
If it is desired to restore the system identification to plain Debian
GNU/Linux, simply uninstalling the package is sufficient:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
apt\-get\ purge\ bunsen\-os\-release
\f[]
.fi
.PP
This removal doesn\[aq]t have any side effects on other parts of the
BunsenLabs system configuration.
.SH KNOWN PROBLEMS
.PP
Some third\-party software fails to function as expected with the
BusnenLabs identification files in place, most notably software dealing
with package management.
An often appearing case is the software\-properties\-{gtk,kde} tool set,
another example is the NodeJS package manager npm.
These applications break since they hard\-code distribution names like
\f[I]Debian\f[] or \f[I]Ubuntu\f[] and disregard unknown names, as well
as distribution relationships as defined by \f[B]os\-release(5)\f[].
A workaround for such problems, short of reporting a bug upstream, is to
just remove the \f[B]bunsen\-os\-release\f[] package.
