# NAME

bunsen-os-release - Operating system identification

# SYNOPSIS

/etc/os/release 

/etc/lsb-release

# DESCRIPTION

BunsenLabs ships its own OS identification files as part of the
**bunsen-os-release** package, which are located in their standard paths
as described in **fsg**(1) (part of the Linux Standard Base) and
**os-release**(5) (part of the systemd configuration environment). The
purpose of these files is to provide third-party programs with
information about the OS such as name, distribution, and version. In
**os-release**(5) in particular also allows for declaring the operating
system family, in the sense of BunsenLabs being derived from Debian.
Programs which use this information include for example the GRUB
bootloader, which installs a boot menu with operating system selection
options, or package management software.

# IMPLEMENTATION

BunsenLabs preserves the original Debian OS information files.
**bunsen-os-release** only defers the existing files to their BL
editions. If it is desired to restore the system identification to plain
Debian GNU/Linux, simply uninstalling the package is sufficient:

    apt-get purge bunsen-os-release

This removal doesn't have any side effects on other parts of the
BunsenLabs system configuration.

# KNOWN PROBLEMS

Some third-party software fails to function as expected with the
BusnenLabs identification files in place, most notably software dealing
with package management. An often appearing case is the
software-properties-{gtk,kde} tool set, another example is the NodeJS
package manager npm. These applications break since they hard-code
distribution names like *Debian* or *Ubuntu* and disregard unknown
names, as well as distribution relationships as defined by
**os-release(5)**. A workaround for such problems, short of reporting a
bug upstream, is to just remove the **bunsen-os-release** package.
