Package: bunsen-python-apt-template
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Enhances: software-properties-gtk, software-properties-kde
Description: Provides a distribution template for python-apt
 Distribution templates used by python-apt are essential to the correct
 functioning of tools depending on that library, for example
 software-properties-{kde,gtk}.  Hitherto, due to the absence of a
 BunsenLabs-specific template, these tools were broken on BunsenLabs.
 .
 This package resolves these issues insofar as tools do not hard-code
 distribution names.
